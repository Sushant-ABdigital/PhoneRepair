# PhoneRepair business concept website
This is the website created with react framework for front-end.
This is the approach of solving customer's problem:
Usually when a phone/mobile device needs a repair then customer needs to visit the repair shop - drop their phone and again
visit the shop to collect the phone.
Solution:
Just book an appointment and an agent will visit your doorstep to repair your device. Pay after satisfactory repair at your home.

Advantages:
- No need to drop your phone to stranger.
- Reduced repair time
- Convenient for customers.
